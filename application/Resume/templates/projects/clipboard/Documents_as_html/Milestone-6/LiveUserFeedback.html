<pre><code>* The site is a great idea for online project management. The site was easy to navigate and understand. The different folders make it convenient to navigate and check progress on different projects at the same time. I really liked the calendar that automatically updates with all the tasks; it's a great feature. It was very easy to visualize and plan ahead.
One thing that bothered me was not having the ability to set a status back to not started, so if you misclicked or had to restart a project, you would have to delete and remake the same task. It would also be nice to see the due date for each task in the main project folder without having to click on each one. 
Overall, it's a very useful and easy-to-use site for keeping track of and managing your projects.

<pre><code>* I could see the potential of this site as an organizational aid; it can be used well to break down projects into their own separate tasks for easier management. That being said, some of the site's features were unintuitive or difficult to follow. Having tasks be required to be a part of a larger list was a bit unintuitive and took time to realize. It would also be nice if you could set timeframes for higher ends of the project (such as the project itself) to all further modular use and flexibility. Instead of having the latest task be the "end" of the current project.

<pre><code>* Easy to use, simplistic. Icons should probably be shifted and resized to match each other, maybe add a log of edits/notes for tasks.

<h3>Turner A -</h3>
<pre><code>* The workflow is very intuitive, I was able to create a simple project with tasks fairly easily. I was a bit annoyed that I couldn’t make a task with no due date, I ended up putting in random dates so that I could finish creating these types of tasks. I also found myself guessing the location of some of the buttons because there isn’t a consistent button style. Although I would usually guess correctly since the layout of the pages is quite good.

<pre><code>* Clipboard allows for an intuitive and streamlined experience for its users to quickly create project task lists. The main appeal is the zero fluff and lightweight feel that makes it fairly easy to get into with minimal learning.

I would say my only complaint is that there is no visual indication at a glance of a task’s labeled priority. So a task that’s been labeled as high priority looks the same as a task labeled low priority.
