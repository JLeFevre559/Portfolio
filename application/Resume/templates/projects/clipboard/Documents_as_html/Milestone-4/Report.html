<h2>Milestone 4 - Code - Joel LeFevre</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What did I do?</p>
<ul>
<li>I spoke with the team and planned out what features we could finish for this milestone, and we also decided upon using github for our issue tracking</li>
<li>I fleshed out the data collected on sign up, and made sure that the sign up functionality worked</li>
<li>I added the ability for a user to edit a project</li>
<li>With the help of ChatGPT, and looking at the tests already developed by our team, I created a tests.py file for running tests with the built in django tests<ul>
<li>I added model tests with help from ChatGPT</li>
<li>I added view tests with help from ChatGPT</li>
<li>I fixed the tests, and items that were being tested so they all worked as expected</li>
<li>Using MongoDB for testing was very slow, so I added an if statement to our settings.py to run tests locally if doing tests<ul>
<li>This cut our testing time down from ~80s to ~6s before I added more tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I added the view and tests for updating task status</li>
<li>I added the ability for users to update task status</li>
<li>I added the view and tests for deleting tasklists</li>
<li>I added the view and tests for updating tasklists</li>
<li>I added the ability for users to create, see, edit, and delete tasklists</li>
<li>I added the view and tests for deleting tasks</li>
<li>I added the view and tests for updating tasks</li>
<li>I added the ability for users to create, see, edit, and delete tasks</li>
<li>I fixed the functionality for the task popup to properly show the data related to the tasks</li>
<li>While doing these things, I added issues that I noticed to our Github issue tracker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will I do? </p>
<ul>
<li>For Milestone 5 I will be in the testing seat, so I will be looking to check all of our tests to ensure that they are covering everything they should be.</li>
<li>I will look to break our tests.py file into multiple testing files to make the code cleaner and more readable</li>
<li>I will look into reducing runtime on our tests</li>
<li>I will look into increasing our testing coverage of the live website</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What challenges do I have?</p>
<ul>
<li>I am unsure of how we will tackle the calendar</li>
<li>I was unable to get the html of the task popup to update until a ctrl+f5 reload</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engineering investment</p>
