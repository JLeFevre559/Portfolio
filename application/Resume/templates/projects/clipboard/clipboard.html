<h1>Clipboard</h1>
<p>Clipboard was a project I undertook in CS350, a class that taught the fundamentals of Software Engineering.</p>
<p>In this class each group had four members with a role for each member.</p>
<p>My group's task was to create a project-tracking taskboard.</p>
<p>The roles in this class were Design, Requirements, Code, and Test, rotating roles each milestone.</p>
<p>For this project, I was the Test role for the first milestone, and rotated through the roles in the order I mentioned them.</p>
<p>There were 7 milestones in this project, each representing important steps in the Software Engineering process.</p>
<p>We kept track of our progress on github in .md documents, and you can click through each milestone below to see a detailed view </p>

          <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
