# Engineering Report

## Milestone 1 - Test - Joel LeFevre

* What did I do?
    * Discussed hosting options for Clipboard
    * Decided on Vercel for Clipboard after a suggestion from Shane, where he indicated it was free, and that we just connect it with our github repo
    * Setup a Django server with Vercel using their Django Hello World Demo that also created our github repo, after which I made our Coder Shane a collaborator on the repo and handed it off to him
    * Setup a local environment to test changes
    * Made our hello world specific to the project
    * Pushed those changes to our main branch to check that it updated on our website
    * Taught my team that the website can be updated by pushing changes to main on our repo, and that the branch can be changed for testing if we're ever testing large changes that may affect deployment
    * Worked with my team to make sure that everyone had a local version of the website working
    * Worked with Shane to make sure that we could still have a running version of our website after we moved all our application code into an application folder, this required changing the root directory on Vercel and making a test branch to check if it would deploy properly before pushing these changes to main
* What will I do?  Test for Milestone 2
    * Work with team to further our development on this project
* What challenges do I have?
    * I'm not all that familiar with github so I'm unsure what version control features are baked in that we can take advantage of in the event we make a mistake
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 6 hours on Test for Milestone 1
    * Our team met for 4 hours
* 5-minute Video Demo
    * I recorded a video and the link to it is in the Test.md file
