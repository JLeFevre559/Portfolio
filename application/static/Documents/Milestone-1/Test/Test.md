# Milestone 1 - Test - Joel LeFevre

Setup the initial web hosting for the project.


## What I did for Milestone 1

### Web Hosting

I selected Vercel for hosting our app using Django as our framework.


### Status Video 

I created a summary of the test and deployment work completed.  View the video at https://youtu.be/tH1JQeyDWrY


## What I will do for Milestone 2

* I am not sure what role I will be for milestone 2, but if I were to still be the testing role I would develop a comprehensive test plan (including Web Testing, System Testing, Unit Testing.) I would also test and research our hosting service to minimize or avoid future issues with our project.


## Concerns and Challenges

* I'm concerned because I've noticed some odd behavior with the .gitignore since we migrated the files into the application folder. This may be a local issue on my end, but if it persists it is something that we will need to look into fixing.
