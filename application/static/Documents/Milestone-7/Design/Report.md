## Milestone 7 - Design - Joel LeFevre

* What did I do?
    * I closed the outstanding issues from our 1.0 release
        * I fixed the popups for editing a task saving the edits on close
        * I fixed the popups for editing a tasklist saving the edit on close
        * I identified the Firefox compatibility issue as version specific
    * I enhanced the existing features on the project page
        * I removed the task detail popup, and replaced it with expanding tasks
        * I changed the tasklists to not match size in the rows, and instead fit the tasks inside of them
        * I changed the tasklists to work in columns where the elements fit together vertically
    * I checked the scalability of Vercel
    * I checked the scalability of MongoDB

* What will I do? 
    * I will continue to maintain this project on Vercel and MongoDB so both myself and my group members will be able to put this project on our resumes.
    

* What challenges do I have?
    * I'm not sure what challenges to expect from maintaining a website as infrastructure updates around it, but I'm looking forward to dealing with these challenges.

* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 12 hours on Design for Milestone 7
    * Our team met for 3 hours

* 5-minute Video Demo
