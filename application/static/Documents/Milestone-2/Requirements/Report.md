## Milestone 2 - Requirements - Joel LeFevre

* What did I do?
    * I worked with my team to identify some of the key features of Clipboard.
    * I created a list of 20 features for our minimum viable product
    * Working with Shane, we queried ChatGPT for suggestions for future enhancements.
    * I worked with Shane to use those ideas, along with a few of our own we'd had into a list of 20 future enhancements.
    * I created a value statement for Clipboard.
    * I created a Product Usage paragraph for Clipboard.
    * I created a Product Overview for Clipboard, leaning heavily into the idea of it being a sales pitch.
    * I troubleshot and resolved an issue we were having with getting static files working on our production server. This was related to an issue where Vercel was detecting that we had a build file, and stopping the build when we did not have a build.sh file. This revealed one additional issue, and solved three errors we got from static files failing to load.
    
* What will I do?  Test for Milestone 2
    * Discuss our database options with my team.
    * Work with team to further our development on this project

* What challenges do I have?
    * Having our server build properly revealed an issue with Vercel. We were planning on using sqlite for our database, but sqlite is not supported by Vercel, so our team is looking into options for a new option for our database.

* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 12 hours on Requirements for Milestone 2
    * Our team met for 6 hours

* 5-minute Video Demo
