# Unimplemented Features - Milestone 4 - Joel LeFevre

As a user, I want a user-viewable calendar.
As a user, I want tasks to be populated on the calendar by their due date.
As a user, I want to add a start and end date to a project.
As a user, I want to add collaborators to a project.

We talked about these features as a team and decided they were unfeasible to get completed in this milestone.
