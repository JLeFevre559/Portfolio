## What I will do for Milestone 5

* For Milestone 5 I will be in the testing seat, so I will be looking to check all of our tests to ensure that they are covering everything they should be.
* I will look to break our tests.py file into multiple testing files to make the code cleaner and more readable
* I will look into reducing runtime on our tests
* I will look into increasing our testing coverage of the live website


## Concerns and Challenges

* I am unsure of how we will tackle the calendar
* I was unable to get the html of the task popup to update until a ctrl+f5 reload
