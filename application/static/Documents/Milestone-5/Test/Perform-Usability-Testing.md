# Perform Usability Testing - Milestone 5 - Test - Joel LeFevre

* I worked with Ryan to perform usability testing for BridgeOut.
* We were unable to do the usability testing in person, so I volunteered to record my usability test and sent him the video.
* I also sent him feedback on the features that I tested, that feedback was as follows: 
    * Thoughts on BridgeOut:
        * The password requirements were laid out well and I could easily understand what they were.
        * I would like to be able to save profile details (First Name, Last Name, etc.) without uploading a profile picture.
        * It's unclear what format the dates are supposed to be to be acceptable, I would like either a hint at the expected format or a select date widget.
        * I cannot interact with education after adding it, the edit and delete buttons return a 403 forbidden error.
        * When deleting a skill it does not show the skill name, so it is unclear what I am deleting.
