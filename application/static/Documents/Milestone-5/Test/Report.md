## Milestone 5 - Test - Joel LeFevre

* What did I do?
    * Reorganized test code
    * Added test files for local and live URLS
    * Added tasklist status functionality
    * Fixed task priority in popup
    * Improved styling of project details page
    * Ran coverage.py for the start of the milestone
        * Added tests to items missing from this run
    * Added tests for home page html
    * Fixed an issue with Signup View
    * I ran coverage.py again to see what I had missed in my pushes to increase test coverage
    * Altered how we approached assignees on tasks so we could have collaborators without additional issues in DB
    * Logged and fixed issues following usability test
    * I ran coverage.py again at the end of the milestone
    * As of the end of this milestone, Clipboard currently has 9 open issues on Github.

* What will I do? 
    * I would like to clean up our tests and reduce the run time of them
    * Continue working on the issues we have logged until we have a fully shippable product (As agreed upon with our customer)
    * Add more tests of our HTML so we can easily see if anything is broken before shipping

* What challenges do I have?
    * I'm a bit shy, so I'm nervous about the customer meeting I'm expecting to have as the requirements role in either milestone 6 or 7

* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 16 hours on Test for Milestone 5
    * Our team met for 4 hours

* 5-minute Video Demo
