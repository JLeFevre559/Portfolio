<h1>Milestone 1 - Test - Joel LeFevre</h1>
<p>Setup the initial web hosting for the project.</p>
<h2>What I did for Milestone 1</h2>
<h3>Web Hosting</h3>
<p>I selected Vercel for hosting our app using Django as our framework.</p>
<h3>Status Video</h3>
<p>I created a summary of the test and deployment work completed.  View the video at https://youtu.be/tH1JQeyDWrY</p>
<h2>What I will do for Milestone 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am not sure what role I will be for milestone 2, but if I were to still be the testing role I would develop a comprehensive test plan (including Web Testing, System Testing, Unit Testing.) I would also test and research our hosting service to minimize or avoid future issues with our project.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Concerns and Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>I'm concerned because I've noticed some odd behavior with the .gitignore since we migrated the files into the application folder. This may be a local issue on my end, but if it persists it is something that we will need to look into fixing.</li>
</ul>
