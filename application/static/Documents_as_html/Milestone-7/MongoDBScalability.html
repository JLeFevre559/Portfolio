<h1>Scalability Report of MongoDB for our App</h1>
<h2>Milestone 7 - Design - Joel LeFevre</h2>
<h1>Checking our current MongoDB Usage against the caps on our free MongoDB plan</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="MongoDBScalability.png">Current Usage</a><ul>
<li>Our current usage is ~606 KB of our cap of 512MB on our current free shared plan.<ul>
<li>This means that our current data usage can grow by ~845 times before we have to expand our storage solution.</li>

<h1>Checking the scaling options offered by MongoDB at https://www.mongodb.com/pricing</h1>
<pre><code>* We could move to a serverless plan with up to 1TB of storage at $.25 per GB-Month, alongside $.10 for each million times data is read from MongoDB and $1.00 per million writes to the DB.
* This would also include 2 free daily backups with a cost of $2.50/hour restored by using the backup
