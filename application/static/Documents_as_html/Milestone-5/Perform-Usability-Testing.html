<h1>Perform Usability Testing - Milestone 5 - Test - Joel LeFevre</h1>
<ul>
<li>I worked with Ryan to perform usability testing for BridgeOut.</li>
<li>We were unable to do the usability testing in person, so I volunteered to record my usability test and sent him the video.</li>
<li>I also sent him feedback on the features that I tested, that feedback was as follows: <ul>
<li>Thoughts on BridgeOut:<ul>
<li>The password requirements were laid out well and I could easily understand what they were.</li>
<li>I would like to be able to save profile details (First Name, Last Name, etc.) without uploading a profile picture.</li>
<li>It's unclear what format the dates are supposed to be to be acceptable, I would like either a hint at the expected format or a select date widget.</li>
<li>I cannot interact with education after adding it, the edit and delete buttons return a 403 forbidden error.</li>
<li>When deleting a skill it does not show the skill name, so it is unclear what I am deleting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
