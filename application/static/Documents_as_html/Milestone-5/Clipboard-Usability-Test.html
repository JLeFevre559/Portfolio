<h1>ClipBoard usability test</h1>
<h2>Landing Page</h2>
<p>When first welcomed to the site things look good. The only change I would reccoment is to make the text a little smaller that tells you what the app does as the user has to scroll down to see the login and signup buttons.</p>
<h2>Creating an Account / Logging in</h2>
<h3>Things that are good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Logging in is straightforward and easy to figure out</li>
<li>Signing up is easy and works properly</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things that could use touch ups</h3>
<ul>
<li>I think it would enhance the user experience if after signing up the user got redirected to the home page rather than the login page.</li>
<li>After logging in the user is greeted with a large page of text with the buttons to add projects or go to their profile. I think it would be nice if the text was formatted a little smaller. I think that it would be nice if there was a create project button on the homepage rather than having to go to projects to create one</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project Management</h2>
<h3>Things that are good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Creating projects is straightforward and intuitive</li>
<li>Creating task lists is easy for the user</li>
<li>Projects and task lists are easily editable</li>
<li>I really like that it shows when something is in progress and how things get marked as done</li>
<li>The expected completion date is a cool feature</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things that could use touch ups</h3>
<ul>
<li>I cannot seem to figure out how to mark an entire project as done or if that is possible, I can only tell if a tasklist is done</li>
<li>When adding a task the description box seems squished in the form and feels like it is in a weird place</li>
<li>While I can select different priorities for tasks there does not seem to be a difference in the project management space. A simple way to do this would be different colors for different priorities. </li>
<li>I think it would be nice if the task lists were organized into completed or incomplete but I also could understand why they would not be to maintain possible organiziation</li>
<li>While I do like the predicted end date it would be nice if there was also an option to add a deadline to a project </li>
<li>If the user tries to add a task without a date the site crashes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Calendar</h2>
<h3>Things that are good</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is a calendar that appears</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things that could use touch ups</h3>
<ul>
<li>Projects and tasks do not show up on the calendar and the calendar does not seem to have much functionality yet</li>
<li>I think it would be nice if all the tasks appeared on the calendar on the date assigned when creating them</li>
<li>A project deadline implempted and shown on the calendar differently than tasks would be useful</li>
<li>It would be useful to be able to add tasks while on the calendar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Profile</h2>
<h3>Things that are good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Profile is created when user account is created and autofilled with the expected information</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things that could use touch ups</h3>
<ul>
<li>It would be nice if the form to change the user account was autofilled with the current information but I do not think its really a big issue</li>
<li>If the user exits the edit profile area without editing anything it saves the username and name as an empty string</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>Overall the website is functional and achieves its purpose. The user is able to create projects and task lists and mark them as in progress or done. The site is easy to navigate and makes sense to the user. The only bug I found was that the entire site crashes if a user tries to add a task without a date. The biggest improvements that should be made are adding functionality to the calendar. There are some minor improvements that should be made on the project side of the site but nothing major. I think the most important thing to add on the project side is a way to tell the difference between low priority and high priority tasks. </p>
